# Shikacracker

Shikacracker is a password cracker inspired by existing software such as
[Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) and [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john),
written to teach myself and other users about password hashing, software optimization and other relevant concepts.

## Dependencies

- C++17 compiler (or newer)
- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
- Probably more to come

## Build Instructions

This project uses CMake (minimum required version 3.10).

1. **Create a build directory and navigate to it:**

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

2. **Configure:**

```bash
cmake ..
```

3. **Build:**

```bash
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

```
Usage: ./shikacracker -m <hash_type> -a <attack_mode> [options]... hashfile dictionary|mask

  -m, --hash-type	Type of hash to use.
  -a, --attack-mode	Attack mode, e.g. dictionary, mask, etc.
  -t, --threads		Number of threads to use for computing hashes (default 2).
  -c, --char-order	File that defines the character order in which password
			candidates for mask attacks should be generated. It should
			contain one character in the first column of each line.
  -[1-4], --custom-charset[1-4]		Define custom charsets to be used in masks.
Help:
  -h, --help		Show this help message and exit.
      --help-hash	Show a list of available hash types and exit.
      --help-mode	Show a list of available attack modes and exit.
      --help-mask	Show information about how to format masks and exit.
```

### Example: Dictionary attack

```
./shikacracker -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt dict.txt
```

Hash each line in `dict.txt` using the MD5 algorithm and check if the hash exists in `hashes.txt`.

### Example: Mask attack

```
./shikacracker -m 3 -a 3 hashes.txt ?d?d?d?d?d?d
```

Generate all strings of length 6 where each character is a digit from 0-9, i.e.

```
000000
000001
...
999998
999999
```

Hash each of them and check if the hash exists in `hashes.txt`.

## Disclaimer 2

This program uses a command-line option syntax similar to that of Hashcat, as I find it clean and user friendly.
However, this implementation is entirely original and does not incorporate or derive from Hashcatâ€™s source code in any way.
