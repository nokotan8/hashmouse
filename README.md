# Shikacracker

Shikacracker is a password cracker inspired by existing software such as
[Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) and [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john),
written to teach myself and other users about password hashing, software optimization and other relevant concepts.

## Dependencies

- C++17 compiler (or newer)
- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
- Probably more to come

## Disclaimer 2

This program uses a command-line option syntax similar to that of Hashcat, as I find it clean and user friendly.
However, this implementation is entirely original and does not incorporate or derive from Hashcatâ€™s source code in any way.
